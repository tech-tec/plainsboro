【健康】牙齦萎縮怎麼救？名醫曝3天逆轉牙周病、口臭關鍵：一輩子不用植牙！ft.牙醫師黃偉家 @JH_dentist ｜下班經濟學378
讓我分享個人的真實見證／

•我被牙醫診斷要深層手術清除牙周病，但我不想接受侵入性治療。於是進行下列方法，至今我的牙齒跟家人的牙齒都逐漸恢復健康=

1. 減糖跟醣，忌吃糖果跟太甜的水果(不再每天吃甜食跟珍奶，改為每個月偶爾吃)
2. 我就是每天用椰子油漱口治好的。起床含一匙椰子油，開始去做早餐約30分鐘，吐掉後再用溫鹽水漱口，口腔就非常乾淨)，連牙齦發炎、甚至口腔內薄膜破了都完全康復。家人的蛀牙也不疼了。
3.餐後用牙線(用手指卷線的比較好)，再用沖牙機，最後使用不含氟牙膏刷牙(有含小蘇打)。

☆需要每天有耐心執行。連去旅行都帶沖牙機。

Hi bought one each for my wife and myself form Aliexpress. The Blood glucose appears to be preprogrammed data same result on both watches. If you use it for say a week and then switch through each day the graph is exactly the same. Checking against a blood glucose meter you will find the results are completely wrong -VERY DANGEROUS watch for blood Glucose.  Appears there maybe no device yet on the market to provide non invasive blood glucose.
Very Disappointing. Like the other functions seem to work fairly well.

I just bought a smartwatch that made the same claims and when I tested it over a few days, my actual blood sugar was about 7.8 but the smart watch said 4.18 and over a few days the numbers never ever matched up, not even close.
